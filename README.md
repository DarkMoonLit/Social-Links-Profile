## Overview
Creating a social links profile with HTML, CSS, FlexBox and Grid.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links
- Live Site URL: (https://darkmoonlit.github.io/Social-Links-Profile/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
I learnt to put down landmarks and using grid.

### Continued development
I will need to learn how to change the layout for each screen size. Since I approach from mobile-first, the desktop version can be small.

### Useful resources

- (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Better understand how to use grid.
